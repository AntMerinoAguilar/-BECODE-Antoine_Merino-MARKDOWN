## Antoine Merino Aguilar - New student at *BeCode*

So my name is **Antoine Merino Aguilar**, I'm **26** years old. I've two sisters and  one brother. I studied during 6 years at *Univeristy of Brussels*. I've learned so much skills in economic, accounting, finance and much more, but at the final that wasn't what I really like. So that's why I'm here ! Also I play football and futsal since I've 7 years.

###### My three most surprising skills :

+ I can make excellent lasagne,
+ I run 10 km in forty minutes,
+ I can fall asleep anywhere at any time in less than 2 minutes.

###### What I like the most :

1. My family,
2. Football,
3. Empanadas.    

I really want to have the enough skills to be able to make some websites for my owm, first. I'm really interested in the visuals, the interactivity with users, all this kind of stuff that we learn in __frontend__.

The fears I have with this training it's maybe the amount of work or the density. You know when you dive into a new world of knowledge it's always intimidating. But I know I can do it !

I'm really excited to be at the end of this training with all the new skills i've learned and to be able to begin my new career. I'm also excited for the new format of *The Champions League* so I'm looking forward to it.

I think that the __three most important soft-skills in work team is__ :
1. Communication,
2.  Team spirit,
3. A sense of responsibility.
